this Privacy Policy cover</span><span class="c6 c2">?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information (&quot;Personal Information&quot;) that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services, but not to the practices of companies we don&rsquo;t own or control, or people that we don&rsquo;t manage. &nbsp;We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with our Services, including to personalize, provide, and improve our services, to allow you to set up a user account and profile, to contact you and allow other users to contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the Services. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c3 c2">As noted in the </span><span class="c12"><a class="c9" href="/terms">Terms of Service</a></span><span class="c3 c2">, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at inquiry@askdouble.com.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c1">Will Double ever change this Privacy Policy</span><span class="c6 c2">?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">We&rsquo;re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on the Double website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. Please note that if you&rsquo;ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven&rsquo;t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. &nbsp;If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes. &nbsp;Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c1">What Information does Double Collect</span><span class="c6 c2">?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c19 c17">Information You Provide to Us:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. &nbsp;For example, through the registration process and/or through your account settings, we may collect Personal Information such as your name, email address, phone number, and third-party account credentials (for example, your log-in credentials for Facebook or other third party sites). Certain information may be required to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">We may communicate with you if you&rsquo;ve provided us the means to do so. For example, if you&rsquo;ve given us your email address, we may send you promotional email offers on behalf of other businesses, or email you about your use of the Services. &nbsp;Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our services. If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by emailing us at inquiry@askdouble.com.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c17 c19">Information Collected Automatically</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, device identification, &ldquo;cookie&rdquo; information, the type of browser and/or device you&rsquo;re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. &ldquo;Cookies&rdquo; are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people. &nbsp;You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device&rsquo;s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Our advertising partners may also transmit cookies to your browser or device, when you click on ads that appear on the Services. Also, if you click on a link to a third party website or service, a third party may also transmit cookies to you. &nbsp;Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren&rsquo;t responsible for their privacy policies and practices. &nbsp;Please be aware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Services, and those third parties may not honor &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; requests you have set using your browser or device.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns. &nbsp;We may also use it to improve the Services &ndash; for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c19 c17">Information Collected From Other Websites and Do Not Track Policy</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services. &nbsp;Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy. &nbsp;Your browser may offer you a &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. &nbsp;Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our Services.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Will Double Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives</span><span class="c6 c2">?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Except as provided below, we do not rent or sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone. We may share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this section:</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c6 c2">Information that&rsquo;s no longer personally identifiable. &nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c2">We may anonymize your Personal Information so that you are not individually identified, and provide that information to our partners. We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners, who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. However, we never disclose aggregate usage information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally, as an individual.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c3 c2">We may deliver a file to you through the Services (known as a &ldquo;web beacon&rdquo;) from an ad network. &nbsp;Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. &nbsp;Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. &nbsp;Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network&rsquo;s servers, these companies can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. &nbsp;You may be able to opt-out of web beacon tracking conducted by third parties through our Services by adjusting the Do Not Track settings on your browser; please note that we don&rsquo;t control whether or how these third parties comply with Do Not Track requests.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c2">Affiliated Businesses:</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we&rsquo;re affiliated with may sell or provide products or services to you through or in connection with the Services (either alone or jointly with us). &nbsp;You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business&rsquo; or websites&rsquo; policies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c2">Agents:</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you; for example, we may use a payment processing company to receive and process your credit card transactions for us. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c6">Business Transfers:</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;We may choose to buy or sell assets, and may share and/or transfer customer information in connection with the evaluation of and entry into such transactions.</span><span class="c17 c25">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c2">Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c2">Protection of Double and Others:</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we reasonably believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our </span><span class="c12 c18"><a class="c9" href="/terms">Terms of Service</a></span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Double, our employees, our users, or others. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is Personal Information about me secure</span><span class="c6 c2">?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. &nbsp;You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c3 c2">We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security. &nbsp;Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c1">What Personal Information can I access</span><span class="c6 c2">?</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c2">Through your account settings you may access, and, in some cases, edit or delete the following information you&rsquo;ve provided to us:</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><ul class="c15 lst-kix_list_3-0 start"><li class="c7"><span class="c2">name and password</span></li></ul><ul class="c15 lst-kix_list_4-0 start"><li class="c7"><span class="c2">email address</span></li></ul><ul class="c15 lst-kix_list_5-0 start"><li class="c7"><span class="c2">location</span></li></ul><ul class="c15 lst-kix_list_6-0 start"><li class="c7"><span class="c2">user profile information, including images and videos you have uploaded to the site</span></li></ul><p class="c8"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2 c3">The information you can view, update, and delete may change as the Services change. &nbsp;If you have any questions about viewing or updating information we have on file about you, please contact us at inquiry@askdouble.com</span><span class="c3 c2">. </span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">What choices do I have</span><span class="c6 c2">?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">You can always opt not to disclose information to us, but keep in mind some information may be needed to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">You may be able to add, update, or delete information as explained above. &nbsp;When you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records. &nbsp;You may request deletion of your account by emailing us inquiry@askdouble.com.
